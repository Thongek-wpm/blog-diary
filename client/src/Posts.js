          Broadway is your ticket to the bright lights, flashy advertisements,
          and gigantic billboards of Times Square. The thoroughfare cuts through
          the commercial hub and forms a town square crossed by hundreds of
          thousands of people daily. Many corporations have offices here, and
          their logos loom above the chaotic pedestrian zones. Wander the plaza
          to find an assortment of costumed characters performing for tips from
          visitors.
